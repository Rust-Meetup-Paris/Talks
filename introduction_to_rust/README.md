This directory holds the source code for an introductory presentation
of the "Rust" programming language. It was delivered by pnkfelix
(Felix S. Klock II) at the Rust Meetup Paris on Tuesday February 25,
2014.

If you want to review the slides from the presentation, the easiest
thing is probably to open the PDF document in this directory.

It is a shortened adaptation of a [similar presentation][1] that
pnkfelix gave at Codemesh 2013 in London.

The slides were created using the [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org)
[Slideshow](http://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/index.html)
language.  (Those are the `.rkt` files in this directory.)  You should
be able to open `presentation.rkt` or any of the `sectN.rkt` files in
DrRacket or Slideshow.
